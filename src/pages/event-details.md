# Event Details

## Hotel
The hotel (Country Inn and Suites) and the conference center (Belvedere Banquets and Events) are located in the same building in Elk Grove Village, IL, just a short shuttle ride from O’Hare Airport.  If you need to use the shuttle from the O'Hare to Country Inn, they require you to call in advance directly to the hotel at 847-534-0600 with your flight number and times. The hours that the shuttle is available is from 9 am to 9 pm. But you do have to make a reservation.   Try to fly in to O’Hare if you can.  Midway and Milwaukee are quite a distance away and the shuttle will not pick up from any locations other than O'Hare.

## Room Block
We have a block of rooms reserved at a discounted rate of $96.00 for 2 queen beds and $ 106.00 for King bed.  These rates are available until September 20, 2017. Inside the ecomChicago website, at the bottom of the page, you can find the information to book a room. You can also call the hotel’s local phone number (847) 534-0600 and mention eCom Chicago to get your discounted rate.  Blocked off rooms & discounted rates are only available from Wed, October 18th to Sunday, October 21. If you plan to come in before the 18th or stay after the 21st, you will need to call the hotel at the number above to extend the discounted rate. Please do not call the toll free number. They are not privy to the rates we negotiated. In the past we have filled up the hotel, so please don't wait to make your reservation.
